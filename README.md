# SonarQube ColdFusion Plugin

[![CI](https://github.com/stepstone-tech/sonar-coldfusion/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/stepstone-tech/sonar-coldfusion/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![Quality Gate Status](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=stepstone-tech_sonar-coldfusion&metric=alert_status)](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=stepstone-tech_sonar-coldfusion) [![Coverage](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=stepstone-tech_sonar-coldfusion&metric=coverage)](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=stepstone-tech_sonar-coldfusion)

A [SonarQube plugin](http://www.sonarqube.org/) for analyzing ColdFusion code, based on the [CFLint library](https://github.com/cflint/CFLint).

## Installation

1. Download the JAR file from the [releases section](https://github.com/stepstone-tech/sonar-coldfusion/releases) or build it yourself by cloning the code and running `mvn install`.
1. Copy `sonar-coldfusion-plugin-{version}.jar` to `<sonarqube dir>/extensions/plugins`.
1. Restart SonarQube.

## Compatibility

SonarQube Version | Plugin Version
------------------|---------------
9.0 - 9.1         | 2.2.0
7.6 - 8.9         | 2.1.1
5.6 - 7.5         | 1.5.0

## Running

Follow the instructions for [analyzing code with SonarQube Scanner](http://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SCAN/Analyzing+with+SonarQube+Scanner). The ColdFusion plugin will automatically discover and analyze `.cfc` and `.cfm` files.

## Parameters tuning

If you encounter log output indicating, that the Compute Engine of SonarQube has insufficient memory, similar to:

```text
2016.06.22 16:17:43 INFO  ce[o.s.s.c.t.CeWorkerCallableImpl] Execute task | project=ApplyNowModule | type=REPORT | id=AVV4eUIgcn4uboqEX1C3
java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded
Dumping heap to java_pid8400.hprof ...
Heap dump file created [565019912 bytes in 6.373 secs]
```

you'll need to increase heap memory on the server, in `<sonarqube dir>/conf/sonar.properties`:

```text
sonar.ce.javaOpts=-Xmx2g -Xms128m -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError
```

2GB might be enough, or perhaps your code base warrants more.

## Building

Run Maven goal

```bash
mvn clean package
```

## Releasing

Setup Maven settings.xml with

```xml
  <servers>
    <server>
        <id>github</id>
        <privateKey>yourprivatekey</privateKey>
    </server>
  </servers>
```

Run Maven goal

```bash
mvn clean package de.jutzig:github-release-plugin:1.3.0:release 
```

This will build the plugin jar file, create a release and a tag on github and upload the artifact to
the [repo](https://github.com/stepstone-tech/sonar-coldfusion).
